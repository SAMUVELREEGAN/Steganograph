Notes on Steganography Tool (Seminar)
1. Introduction to Steganography
Definition: The practice of concealing messages or information within non-secret text or data, such as images, audio, or video files.
Purpose: Ensures secrecy and adds an extra layer of security for sensitive information.
2. Overview of the Tool
A Python-based application using Tkinter for GUI and Stegano (LSB) for steganographic operations.
3. Key Features
Open Image: Allows users to upload images (supports .png, .jpg, .jpeg formats).
Hide Data: Embeds user-entered text into an image using LSB (Least Significant Bit) encoding.
Show Data: Extracts hidden messages from a previously encoded image.
4. Technical Components
Python Libraries:
tkinter: For GUI development.
filedialog & messagebox: For file operations and error handling.
PIL (Pillow): For image processing.
stegano.lsb: For hiding and revealing messages.
Image Processing:
Resizes the image to fit within a 300x300 canvas using Image.Resampling.LANCZOS.
LSB Encoding:
Utilizes the least significant bits of pixel data to encode the message without perceptible changes.
5. GUI Layout
Header: Displays the tool's title.
Canvas: Shows the uploaded image.
Message Box: A single text box for entering or displaying hidden messages.
Buttons:
Open Image: Uploads an image for steganographic operations.
Hide Data: Encodes the message into the image and saves it as a .png file.
Show Data: Reveals hidden messages from an uploaded image.
6. Implementation Workflow
Opening an Image:
Prompts user to select an image.
Prepares it for encoding/decoding.
Hiding Data:
Accepts user input as the message.
Embeds the message into the image and saves it to a user-specified location.
Revealing Data:
Decodes and displays the hidden message in the text box.
7. User Interaction
Buttons dynamically enable/disable based on operations (e.g., Hide Data enabled after an image is uploaded).
8. Error Handling
Provides user-friendly messages for issues like invalid input, file path errors, or decoding failures.
9. Applications
Secure communication.
Protecting sensitive information.
Digital watermarking.
10. Limitations
Limited to LSB-based image steganography.
Does not provide encryption for the message.
11. Conclusion
A simple, intuitive tool for learning and demonstrating steganography principles.
Can be expanded to include advanced encoding techniques and additional media types.
